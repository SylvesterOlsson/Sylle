            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> My name is Sylvester Galapia Olsson, I am 21 years old, I currently study multimedia design at UCL in Odense, Denmark.  I chose this course because of my interests and adoration for the making of movies, tv and commercials.  Prior to starting at UCL I attended general upper secondary school in Esbjerg, at that time I studied the artistic course which partially consisted of an abundance of media study. By inquiring knowledge and insight of this subject has given me the determination to submerge myself in the world of media even further.

            <h1>My Passion</h1>
            <p>  My passions are partly as mentioned before tv, commercials as well as movies.  I am truly fascinated by the way great cinema captivates the viewer, how a single sequence can make you resting on the edge of the seat, how movies can make you feel certain emotions, how in a matter of minutes you can feel like a whole different person, as well as having your entire perspective changed. Regarding advertisement It is interesting how a simple ad can tell so much, as well as how it directly sends a message to its target group.

            <h1>My Assets </h1>
            <p> I am currently  studying multimedia design which means I only have a finite amount of expertise; however, I have a modest grasp of editing programs such as Adobe Premier Pro, Adobe Illustrator as well as Adobe Photoshop. Additionally, I value a sincere and serious work environment, I appreciate a work environment where the employees can excel with their tasks and projects. I myself can offer a creative thinker who are always looking for means to grown as well as learn to become a valuable employee.
